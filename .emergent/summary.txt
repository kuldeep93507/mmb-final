The AI engineer successfully built an MMB Portfolio Website from scratch, progressing from a mock-data-driven frontend to a full-stack application with a functional backend and an integrated admin panel. The initial phase focused on extensive frontend design, iteratively adjusting layout, animations, content, and hero sections based on user feedback, including strict adherence to a provided screenshot. Key challenges during backend development involved setting up MongoDB models, authentication (JWT, bcrypt), CRUD APIs, and resolving environment variable issues (). The integration phase proved complex, requiring the replacement of mock data with real API calls across multiple frontend pages and addressing UI refresh issues and authorization header problems in the admin panel. The current state is a mostly integrated system, with the immediate task being the synchronization of user profile details from the admin panel to the frontend's footer and WhatsApp button.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a MMB Portfolio Website with a modern, professional UI, aiming for a luxury yet simple vibe.
**Frontend Features:**
*   **Homepage:** Hero section, About section preview, Services highlight, Call-to-Action (Contact/Hire Me). Projects section should display at least 6 projects.
*   **Services Page:** Details on services like Website Development, Landing Page, UX Design, Content Writing, WordPress.
*   **Projects / Portfolio Page:** Showcase of past work with filters.
*   **Testimonials Page:** Client reviews.
*   **Blog Page:** Articles/Guides related to web, UX, AI tools, with realistic and comprehensive content.
*   **Contact Page:** Form (Name, Email, Message) with auto-mail integration (though not yet implemented).
*   **Design Specifics:** Layout should match a provided screenshot with a modern touch (clean fonts, smooth animations, minimal color scheme), 3D animated MMB banner in hero section, scroll-to-top navigation. User's personal details (Kuldeep Parjapati, Modern Web Solutions Expert) should be prominent.

**Backend Features (Admin Panel):**
*   **Dashboard:** Overview with statistics (inquiries, projects).
*   **Manage Services:** Add/Edit/Delete services.
*   **Manage Projects:** Add/Edit/Delete projects with screenshots and descriptions.
*   **Manage Testimonials:** Add/Edit/Delete client reviews.
*   **Manage Blog Posts:** Full blog editor.
*   **Manage Inquiries:** View all contact form queries.
*   **Profile Settings:** Edit personal details (name, email, phone, WhatsApp) and social media links.
*   **Authentication:** Secure login for admin.

**Phase 2 Upgrade (Future):**
*   AI Chatbot for visitor queries (services, pricing, delivery time, FAQs).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components for modern UI elements.
- **Data Fetching/State Management:** Axios for API calls, React Context for authentication.
- **Authentication:** JWT for token-based auth, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Database ORM/ODM:** Pydantic models for data validation, Motor for async MongoDB.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM for frontend navigation, FastAPI  for backend.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend services. The frontend is a React application, and the backend is a FastAPI server connected to a MongoDB database.



- ****: This is the core of the backend.
    - It initializes the FastAPI app, sets up CORS middleware, and includes separate API routers for .
    - It connects to MongoDB using  and defines shutdown events.
    - **Changes:** Initially contained a basic  endpoint and status checks. It was heavily modified to include the  for all backend routes (public and admin) and to properly load environment variables for MongoDB connection after an initial .
- ****: Defines Pydantic models for all entities stored in MongoDB, such as , , , , , , and . These models ensure data validation and consistent structure.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch to define the data schema for the application's entities.
- ****: Handles user authentication, including password hashing with , JWT token generation and validation.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch to implement user registration, login, and token-based authentication.
- ****: Contains FastAPI endpoints for the admin panel, providing CRUD operations for all managed entities (services, projects, testimonials, blogs, contacts, profile) and requiring authentication.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch and progressively expanded to cover all admin functionalities. Database connection handling was also fixed here.
- ****: Contains FastAPI endpoints for the public user-facing parts of the application, fetching data for services, projects, testimonials, blogs, and submitting contact inquiries.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch to serve data to the user panel and handle contact form submissions.
- ****: A script to populate the MongoDB database with initial demo data for admin users, services, projects, etc., making the admin panel functional immediately.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch to facilitate initial testing and provide sample data.
- ****: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for setting up client-side routing using  and defining the overall application structure.
    - **Changes:** Initially had a basic Home route. It was extensively updated to include routes for all frontend pages (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Testimonials, Blog, Contact) and all admin pages (Dashboard, Login, Services, Projects, Contacts, Profile, Testimonials, Blogs), often within protected routes. Logic for fetching initial user profile data was also added here.
- ****: Provides authentication context to the entire frontend, managing user login state, JWT token, and providing functions for login/logout. It also sets up Axios interceptors to automatically include the authorization header for authenticated requests.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch. Was crucial for fixing authorization issues in the admin panel by ensuring the JWT token was correctly attached to API requests.
- ** (all pages)**: These components represent the individual pages of the user-facing website and the admin panel.
    - **Changes:** Initially implemented with mock data (). They were subsequently modified to fetch real data from the backend APIs, handle loading states, and integrate with the  for admin pages. Design elements were frequently adjusted based on user feedback, particularly for the homepage to match a specific screenshot.

<pending_tasks>
- Connect the user panel's footer and WhatsApp button to the backend to display dynamic profile details.
- Provide instructions on how to host and deploy the project.
- Implement auto-mail integration for the contact form.
- Develop the AI Chatbot as a Phase 2 upgrade.

<current_work>
Currently, the core MMB Portfolio website is built as a full-stack application. The frontend (user panel) displays most data (services, projects, testimonials, blog) fetched from the backend, and the contact form submits data to the backend, which is visible in the admin panel. The admin panel is fully functional, allowing CRUD operations for services, projects, contacts, testimonials, and blogs, including a working profile settings page where details can be updated.

However, a specific nuance is that **the user's profile details updated in the admin panel are not yet reflected on the public user-facing frontend's footer and WhatsApp button.** These elements are still using static or mock data for contact information, even though the backend profile API and admin-side updates are working correctly. The AI engineer has acknowledged this specific discrepancy.
